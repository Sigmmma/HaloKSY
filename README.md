This repo contains `ksy` (YAML) definitions for tags (and other) files for Halo
games. These definitions can be compiled into usable source code for many
different languages using [Kaitai Struct](https://kaitai.io/). This repo is
intended to be a minimal source of truth other projects can include and build
off of (e.g. as a submodule).
